# Data Science Bootcamp | Project 1


Data Science &amp; Analytics Bootcamp | Covid Analysis Project 


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Due to the NEVER ENDING pandemic we decided to take a look at this data from 2 different sources and merge them together. We want to find out if political party affects the number of covid cases and/or deaths per state.

### Technical Requirements 
 * Use Pandas to clean and format your data set

 * Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process

 * Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis

 * Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

 * Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

 * Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

 * Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.


### Presentation Requirements 
 * Be at least 8-10 min. long

 * Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.

 * Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

 * Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

 * Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

 * Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

 * Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

 * Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".

 * Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* Cases by state 

* Democratic states have more or less cases than Republican states 

* Dependent vs. Independent Variables
